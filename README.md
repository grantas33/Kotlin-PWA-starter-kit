## Overview

This starter kit is a Gradle project that uses the Kotlin/JS Gradle plugin and consists of two modules - client and service worker.

Both modules use Kotlin Coroutines library to handle asynchronous operations in a way idiomatic to Kotlin.

Client module includes [React](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-react) and [styled-components](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-styled) libraries wrapped in Kotlin.
